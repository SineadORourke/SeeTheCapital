<!-- Commented by Sinead O'Rourke.
        This xml file is auto-generated by Android Studio when the navigation Drawer is created. The item (with id 'action_settings') is referenced in the
        onOptionsItemSelected() override method for the Navigation Drawer, and the xml file itself is called in the onCreateOptionsMenu() override method
        to inflate the menu /-->
